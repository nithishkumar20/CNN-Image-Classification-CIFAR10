# CNN-Image-Classification-CIFAR10
The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

I have used Keras to build an image classification model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It uses the following layers/functions:

- For building the Model - CNN, Maxpooling and Dense Layers.
- For Activation Function - ReLU (in CNN layers for handling image pixels) and Softmax (for final classification).
